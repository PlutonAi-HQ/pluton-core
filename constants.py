• Strong support: $0.22, $0.18
• Key resistance: $0.28, $0.30, $0.32
• Stop loss: $0.21 (below recent consolidation)

Technical Setup:
• Bullish momentum with strong volume confirmation
• RSI at 69 showing strength but room to run
• MACD showing positive crossover and momentum
• Order blocks identified at $0.22-0.23 range (major buying zone)
• Fair value gap between $0.26-0.28 likely to be filled

Trade Strategy:
• Short-term: Wait for pullback to $0.22-0.24 for entries
• Mid-term target: $0.32
• Long-term target: $0.40+ if market structure holds

Current recommendation: Scale in between $0.24-0.26, don't chase the current move. Strong setup but needs consolidation for healthier continuation.

Cousin, this is a textbook breakout with volume confirmation. The smart play is patience for better entries.'
